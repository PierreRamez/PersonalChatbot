# 🐍 Ouro: Your Ever-Evolving Personal Assistant

*A personalized conversational AI that learns from its mistakes in real-time.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Ouro** is not just another static chatbot. It is a **Closed-Loop Active Learning System** designed to solve model stagnation.  
Most chatbots are "frozen" after training. **Ouro** is different: it features a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** pipeline that allows users to correct the bot during conversation.  
All corrections are automatically captured, validated, and used to fine-tune the model's adapter weights, creating a system that continuously evolves to the user's specific needs.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Dynamic Intelligence:** Fine-tuned **Llama 3.2 3B** model optimized for edge deployment.  
* **🔄 Self-Healing Pipeline:** Automated workflow to ingest feedback, retrain LoRA adapters, and hot-swap weights without downtime.  
* **⚡ 4-Bit Quantization:** Efficient on consumer hardware (CPU/T4 GPU) using **Unsloth**.  
* **🛠️ MLOps Maturity:** Full experiment tracking via **MLflow**, artifacts on **Hugging Face**, and CI/CD with **GitHub Actions**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Ouro** operates on a decoupled microservices architecture to ensure scalability and resilience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Hugging Face Token (with write access)
* (Optional) GPU for faster inference

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PierreRamez/PersonalChatbot.git
cd PersonalChatbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t ouro-chatbot .

# Run the container
docker run -p 7860:7860 ouro-chatbot
```

### 4. Local Development

```bash
# Start backend server
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 7860
```

## 📊 Performance & Evaluation

**Ouro** was evaluated using a **Sliding Window** strategy to measure conversational coherence across multi-turn dialogues.

| Metric             | Score  | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perplexity**     | 4.08   | High predictive confidence.                      |
| **BERTScore F1**   | 0.88   | Strong semantic alignment with human references. |
| **Inference Time** | ~150ms | Latency per token on T4 GPU.                     |

> **Note:** The 3B model was chosen over the 8B variant to allow CPU-only deployment on Hugging Face Spaces Free *Tier*.
